    <p style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;font-size: 110%;padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;">Constructing a text scores website necessitates a fusion of fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the cornerstone, shaping the structure and conte
      nt of your web pages. Within HTML, you can establish the layout, headings, and containers for your text scores. Cascading 
      Style Sheets (CSS) empowers you to articulate the visual style and arrangement of your site, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and
       user-friendly experience. CSS facilitates the design of fonts, colors, and the overall presentation of your text score displays.

      JavaScript, a dynamic scripting language, introduces interactivity to your text scores site. It empowers the 
      creation of features such as user interactions, real-time updates, and the capability to submit and retrieve scores and comments. 
      Leveraging JavaScript, you can implement rating systems, comment sections, and other elements that engage users, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;font-size: 110%;padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;">HTML serves as the building block for crafting the structure and content of your webpage. Utilize HTML to define the layout of 
      your survey and the various elements with which users will interact. Employ CSS to enhance the visual appeal and user-friendliness of your webpage.
       JavaScript comes into play to inject interactivity into your survey website, managing form submissions, data collection, 
       and the presentation of survey results.

      Within the JavaScript code, we actively listen for the form's submission event, capturing the user's responses. Subsequently,
       we generate a list item containing the user's responses and append it to the results list. To prepare for the next user, the form is reset,
        clearing the input fields for a seamless experience..</p>
